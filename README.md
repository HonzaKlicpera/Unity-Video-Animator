# Unity Video Animator
This repository contains a simple system for utilizing live-action animations in the video format. The animations were edited using a [custom Blender addon](https://github.com/HonzaKlicpera/Effective-footage-processing-Blender) and stylized using [EbSynth](https://ebsynth.com/).
